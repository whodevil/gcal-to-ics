#+title: gcal to org-agenda

This uses google's api to retrieve events from a private google calendar and land them
in a directory as org files.

* Pre-requisites

- Make a copy of the ~example.configuration.properties~ file. By default the project looks for a file in this project dir named ~configuration.properties~.
- Read [[https://developers.google.com/calendar/api/quickstart/java][Google's Java Quickstart]] then update the properties file with the fully qualified path to the json file downloaded as part of the guide.

* Run

NOTE: the first time you run the project, there will be an interactive step, where you must open a link and give the app
access to your google calendar. Check the logs for this link.

#+begin_src shell
./gradlew run
#+end_src

* Tell emacs about the output dir

#+begin_src elisp
(setq org-agenda-files (list "/path/to/org/agenda/directory/")
#+end_src
